# Tools
These tools are intended to provide examples of how to build application components, as well as how to reuse services when possible

The [todo](todo-tool.md) and [discussions](./discussions.md) tools are both generic, and arguably useful.

But they are better understood when seen in the context of [incidents](../apps/incidents.md), where they are combined as components to a larger solution.

Note that all of the tools included here could have been implemented as [applications](../site-admin/applications.md).  However, they are implemented as they are to illustrate different scenarios.

Any and all can be removed from the stack along with their dependencies just by deleting the appropriate migrations, tests, and .vue files - most of which are nicely grouped into directories lending themselves to this task.
